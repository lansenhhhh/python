Made in China was once the presentation of low price and bad quality. In western movies, when people saw the label of Made in China, they would look down upon the products, or just made fun of these products. But now, Chinese products astonish foreigners by good quality and low price, and many of them are willing to spend money on the products that labelled with Made in China. Chen Guangxi made a speech in the New York University about the changes of Made in China. He said when he started his business and sought cooperation with foreign manufacturers, they refused, because they feared Chinese quality. Now his business is successful and many foreigners are willing to do business with him. The great change shows the rise of China. In the future, more Chinese products will be admitted in the world.
